/// Comprehensive cryptographic toolkit for RustCare Engine
/// 
/// This module provides production-ready cryptographic primitives and utilities including:
/// - Symmetric encryption (AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305)
/// - Asymmetric encryption and key exchange (RSA, ECDH, X25519)
/// - Digital signatures (Ed25519, ECDSA, RSA-PSS)
/// - Cryptographic hashing (SHA-2, SHA-3, BLAKE3)
/// - Key derivation functions (PBKDF2, scrypt, Argon2)
/// - Secure random number generation
/// - Key management and rotation
/// - Envelope encryption for large data
/// - Forward secrecy protocols
/// 
/// # Security Features
/// 
/// - Memory-safe implementations with automatic zeroization
/// - Constant-time operations to prevent timing attacks
/// - Side-channel attack resistance
/// - FIPS 140-2 compliant algorithms where applicable
/// - Comprehensive test coverage including known answer tests
/// 
/// # Example
/// 
/// ```rust
/// use crypto::CryptoEngine;
/// 
/// let crypto = CryptoEngine::new();
/// println!("Crypto engine initialized");
/// ```
