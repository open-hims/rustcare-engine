      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   12. Optional Proprietary Extensions by Licensor.

       IMPORTANT: The OpenHIMS core platform is and will always remain
       completely open-source. This section only addresses optional
       proprietary extensions that the Licensor may develop separately.

       (a) LICENSOR'S RIGHT TO CREATE PROPRIETARY EXTENSIONS.
           While the OpenHIMS core platform remains fully open-source, the
           Licensor reserves the right to develop and distribute certain
           OPTIONAL packages, modules, or features under separate proprietary
           licenses that are NOT subject to this open-source license.
           
           These are completely separate products, not part of the core platform.

       (b) CORE PLATFORM REMAINS FULLY FUNCTIONAL.
           The open-source core platform provides complete, production-ready
           healthcare interoperability functionality without any proprietary
           extensions. Proprietary extensions are OPTIONAL enhancements only.
           
           The Licensor commits to:
           (i)    Never removing features from open-source to create paid versions
           (ii)   Maintaining the core as fully functional and competitive
           (iii)  Never requiring proprietary extensions for standard use cases
           (iv)   Documenting which features are open-source vs. proprietary

       (c) SCOPE OF OPTIONAL PROPRIETARY EXTENSIONS.
           Optional proprietary extensions may include:
           
           (i)    Advanced enterprise management consoles
           (ii)   Specialized analytics and business intelligence
           (iii)  AI/ML predictive models and algorithms
           (iv)   Proprietary optimization algorithms
           (v)    White-label or OEM-specific versions
           (vi)   Managed service automation tools
           
           These are value-added enhancements, not core functionality.

       (d) COMMUNITY CAN BUILD ALTERNATIVES.
           The community is explicitly encouraged and permitted to build
           open-source alternatives to any proprietary extensions. The
           Licensor will:
           
           (i)    Maintain open, documented APIs for all integrations
           (ii)   Never create intentional incompatibilities
           (iii)  Support community-built alternatives
           (iv)   No lock-in mechanisms or proprietary protocols
           (v)    Ensure core platform works with any compatible extensions

       (e) SEPARATE LICENSING FOR PROPRIETARY EXTENSIONS.
           Any proprietary extensions are subject to their own separate:
           
           (i)   End User License Agreement (EULA)
           (ii)  Pricing and licensing terms
           (iii) Support and maintenance agreements
           (iv)  Distribution restrictions
           
           These terms do NOT affect the open-source core platform.

       (f) TRANSPARENCY COMMITMENT.
           The Licensor commits to:
           
           (i)    Clearly label what is open-source vs. proprietary
           (ii)   Publish a list of proprietary extensions (if any)
           (iii)  Never mislead users about open-source status
           (iv)   Respond to community feedback on commercialization
           (v)    Prioritize open-source development over proprietary extensions

       (g) HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS GET FREE ACCESS.
           Healthcare providers (as defined in Section 11.a) receive free
           access to proprietary extensions if available, in support of
           their mission to improve healthcare delivery.

       (h) NOTE ON CURRENT STATUS.
           As of the date of this license, no proprietary extensions exist.
           All OpenHIMS components are fully open-source. This section
           reserves the right for future optional proprietary extensions
           should they be developed.
           
           Any future proprietary extensions will be announced transparently
           to the community.

   13. Audit Rights.

       If You are a Commercial Entity or Healthcare Enterprise using the Work,
       You agree that the Licensor may, upon reasonable notice and during
       normal business hours, audit Your use of the Work to verify compliance
       with these license terms. You agree to reasonably cooperate with such
       audits and provide necessary documentation.

   14. No Confusion or Misrepresentation.

       (a) CLEAR DISTINCTION REQUIRED.

           (i)   Open-source components licensed under this license

           (ii)  Do not claim commercial packages are open-source

           (iv)  Follow branding guidelines for OpenHIMS trademarks
           (v)   See BRANDING-GUIDE.md for detailed requirements

       These additional terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance
       with the laws of the jurisdiction where the Licensor is established,
       without regard to conflict of law principles.

   16. Severability.

       If any provision of these additional terms is held to be unenforceable
       or invalid, such provision shall be changed and interpreted to
       accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent
       possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions shall
       continue in full force and effect.
