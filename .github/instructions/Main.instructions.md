Dont create readme or instruction files unless explicitly requested.
Mainly check for modules that we can reuse without reinventing the wheel.

No Readme or instruction files should be created after finishing the task unless explicitly requested.

# UI 

- Use consistent spacing and layout throughout the UI components.
- Ensure all form elements have associated labels for accessibility.
- Use a consistent color scheme and typography across all UI components.
- Check for existing components that can be reused instead of creating new ones.

# Review Recently Edited Files
Please review the following recently edited files for potential reusable modules, functions, or structures that can be abstracted into shared libraries or utilities. Look for common patterns, repeated code, or functionalities that could benefit from modularization.
